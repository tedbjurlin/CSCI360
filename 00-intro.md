Module 00: Introduction to CSCI 360
===================================

Welcome to your first module for CSCI 360, Programming Languages!  In
this course we will be taking a somewhat different approach than you
may be used to.  Although there will be some traditional lecturing,
much of your time in class will be spent working in teams to complete
*modules* like this one.  Each module will guide you through a
learning process on a particular topic.  However, although the modules
themselves will form the primary framework for your learning, there
will also be ample opportunity to interact with me and with your
classmates.

Please read and follow the instructions below, and fill in answers and
information as requested.  The completed module should be [turned in
electronically via this Google
form](https://forms.gle/kZ2RFNjsKquheBob7) before the beginning of
class on Monday.  Each team only needs to turn in one completed
module for the whole team.

Questions or instructions that require some sort of action or response
are preceded by an asterisk * (or a bullet, if you are reading the
HTML version).  This file is written using *Markdown* syntax.  You can
[read about Markdown here](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax).
[pandoc](http://pandoc.org/) can be used to convert Markdown to HTML.

Remember to use complete sentences and correct punctuation when
filling in your responses!

Get to know your team
---------------------

The person who is typing is the "driver" (for now).  The driver's
responsibility is to operate the computer, being careful to listen to
input from their teammates.

* Write the name of your driver below:

Ted Bjurnlin


Note that the role of driver, and the other roles described below, are
not fixed: they will vary from class to class and even within the same
class.

The other team member(s) are "navigators".  Their responsibility is to
give input to help guide the driver, and to carefully check any code
the driver writes.  Navigators may also use another computer or device
to look up reference information, but the team **should only be working
on one copy of the module**.

* Write the name of your navigator(s) here:

JC Ntambara

* The driver should ask the navigator (if your team has more than one
  navigator, pick one) the following questions, and record their
  answers below.  If necessary, everyone can pause for a few minutes
  to think through their answers to the questions.

    * What programming language are you most familiar with?

    Python, Java, Javascript, and SQL

    * Name one thing you like and one thing you dislike about that
      language.

    Python is easy to use and understandable because it is similar to English and the syntax is easy to understand, nothing in particular to dislike.

* Now let someone else be the driver, and repeat the above process.

    * What programming language are you most familiar with?

    Python

    * Name one thing you like and one thing you dislike about that
      language.

    Easy to learn and understand due to how it's set up (syntax in general). Dislikes how it's not a compatible language, or slower than languages like Java.


* If you have three people on your team, repeat the process again for
  the last driver.

    * What programming language are you most familiar with?
    * Name one thing you like and one thing you dislike about that
      language.


At this point everyone should have had a chance to type, and you
should have recorded everyone's responses to the questions.  The
original driver can now resume their original role.


Get to know the syllabus
------------------------

Find the syllabus for CSCI 360 on the
[course webpage](https://hendrix-cs.github.io/csci360/).

* Where is Dr. Yorgey's office?

MC Reynolds 310

* Write down a time that your team *could* meet with Dr. Yorgey within
  the next week.  Make sure it is a time that your team members and
  Dr. Yorgey are all free. (You do not have to actually sign up for a
  meeting, although you can if you want to.)

At noon on Thursday

* What is due on Friday?

Student info survey

* What is due on Monday?

Grading contract and Modules 0 and 1

* Can you work on projects as a group?

No, projects must be completed individually.

* What do you need to do to earn a B in this class?

Complete the survey, submit and agree on a grading contract, complete two grading contract evaluations, Complete at least 10 modules, at least four projects with at least one at level 3 and two at level 2, and complete at least 80% of assigned swarm scenarios.

* You turn in Module 0 on time, Module 1 late, and then revise
  Module 0.  Along the way you visit Dr. Yorgey's office twice and
  solve an extra Swarm challenge scenario.  How many tokens do you have?

You have 3 1/2 tokens.

* Is it a violation of the academic integrity policy to look at the
  code written by another group, assuming you do not copy it?

Yes.

* Is it a violation of the academic integrity policy to discuss an
  assignment with another group?

No.

* You found a few lines of code on Stack Overflow that were helpful,
  but in the process of trying to understand them you ended up
  completely rewriting them from scratch, and then later you actually
  deleted them since you didn't need them after all.  Do you need to
  cite the Stack Overflow page?  Why or why not?

No but you probably should.
