To the best of my knowledge, I have kept on top of my grading contract. I so far think that it is accurate for what I expect out of myself in this class, and I have chosen to lower the last two projects to level two to give myself the space to succeed in my other classes as they increase in difficulty. So far I feel like I have been able to grasp the course material well, and that I have a good understanding of what this class is teaching. I do think I should get better at reading the instructions for assigments, as I have had a couple of misunderstandings that have now been resolved. Overall, I think that I am enjoying the class so far, although I would like the groups to be switched up more often, if that is something that you are planning on doing.
